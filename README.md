# Attendance-Management-OpenCV
This OpenCv project is about marking attendance based on facial recognition. 

Save the images of persons for attendance in imagesAtt folder. Image name must be the person name. 
This will check each persons face with the images saved in imagesAtt folder. If any picture of camera matches 
with the images saved, it will save the name in csv file along with time.
